# Projects Directory

This directory contains individual website projects. Each project should be in its own subdirectory.

## Creating a New Project

1. Create a new directory for your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-project-name
   cd my-project-name
   ```

2. Add a README.md describing your project

3. Set up your project structure based on your needs

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens for directory names: `my-website`, `portfolio-site`
- Be descriptive: Use names that clearly indicate what the project is
- Avoid spaces and special characters

## Project Structure

Each project should be self-contained with its own:

- Source code
- Dependencies
- Documentation
- Build configuration
- Tests (if applicable)

## Example Projects

Check the `templates/` directory for starter templates you can copy to begin new projects.
